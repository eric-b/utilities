# Various small utilities

## Disclaimer

These are not maintained projects.
Feel free to reuse it if useful, feel free to PR, but don't expect fast answers in case of bug ;-).

## How to (re)use

I try to wrap each utility into a single file. Just drop the file you're interested in into your project.

## netstat

Just a wrapper around Windows 'netstat' command (launch an external process).
